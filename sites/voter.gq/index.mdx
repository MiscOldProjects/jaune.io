# Vote Simulation ...

### Electronic Vote is a powerful group decision tools

At [Gradual Quanta][1], we implemented the first [eco-social][2]
voting platforme on blockchain that doesn't consume lot's of energy to secure the ledger.

Our approach is simple, we run a permissionned ledger so any [Sybil attack][3] doesn't temper the vote's results.

  "I, person A, vouch for the fact that person B is a member of this group"

  One such approach is thePublic Key Infrastructure, or PKI [6]. Briefly,
  a PKI consists of variousCertificationAuthorities(or CA’s) that
  issuecertificatesasserting a binding between a name and a public
  key. PKI’s suffer fromtwo fundamental problems: the lack of useful
  meaning in the PKI’s underlying namespace, and the question of whichCA
  to trust. Actual implementations of CA’s have proved themselves not
  worthy of absolute trust. Further, asthe number of CA’s deployed
  scales up, the risk of any one of them being compromised scales
  accordingly. In partbecause of these two problems, PKI’s have met
  with limited success at best.
